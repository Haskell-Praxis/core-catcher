Each energy type should be present in this map.

This is the size of the circle that lies behind a node to represent
that the node has a stop for the given energy

Each energy type should be present in this map.

{-| A tuple that contains all information needed to display a network.

The first 3 entries are maps that store the color, edgeWidth and nodeSize per energy type

The 4th entry is a map of coordinates per node

The 5th entry is the list of energies used in order which they should be rendered.
The smallest / thinnest energy type should be named last.

The 6th entry is a map that mapps each player to a color
