Each transport type should be present in this map.

Each transport type should be present in this map.

This is the size of the circle that lies behind a node to represent
that the node has a stop for the given transport

Each transport type should be present in this map.

{-| A tuple that contains all information needed to display a network.

The first 3 entries are maps that store the color, edgeWidth and nodeSize per transport type

The 4th entry is a map of coordinates per node

The 5th entry is the list of transports used in order which they should be rendered.
The smallest / thinnest transport type should be namen last.

The 6th entry is a map that mapps each player to a color

The 1st entry is the color in which the edges and node rings are drawn.
The 2nd entry is the width of the edges, the 3rd is the size of the rings around the nodes.

The 4th entry is a map of coordinates per node, the same in the NetworkDisplayInfo type.
