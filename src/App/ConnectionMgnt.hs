This module implements functions managing Client Connections inside a bigger state-type.

The state-type has to be kept within an TVar variable and the update functions are done using IO

For instances, it is only necessary to TODO

Note: this is used for preventing mutually recursive modules.

TODO: write about what is exported and how to use this module
